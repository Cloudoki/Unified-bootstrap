# Unified-Bootstrap
Bootstrap package with the Unified Theme, built with Less & Grunt

## Requirements
You'll need to have the following items installed before continuing.

  * [Node.js](http://nodejs.org): Use the installer provided on the NodeJS website.
  * [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/): Run `[sudo] npm install -g grunt-cli`
  * [Bower](http://bower.io): Run `[sudo] npm install -g bower`

## Custom files & settings
All the settings, changes and new classes of this package are in the /less/unified folder. Without this, it's just a regular Bootstrap package.

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Cloudoki/Unified-Bootstrap.git
npm install && bower install
```

To apply magic, run:

`grunt`
`grunt watcher`

Voila!
